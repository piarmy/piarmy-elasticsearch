The creation of Ecliptic Brewing is the next chapter in John's illustrious career.The name Ecliptic Brewing unites John's two passions: brewing and astronomy. The ecliptic is the yearly path around the sun on planet Earth. We celebrate this journey through the seasons from the centerpiece to our pub, a massive light fixture in the shape of the Analemma, to beer and food menus in constant change and rotation throughout the year. Our seasonal menu will rotate every 6 weeks on the old world calendar. Changes at Samhian, Winter Solstice, Bridgid, Spring Equinox, Beltane, Summer Solstice, Lammas and the Autumnal Equinox.Our philosophy is to push the limits of creativity in the brewhouse, and create a sense of place in both the restaurant and the beer we build.

The brewery is family owned and operated, a proud member of the Oregon Brewers Guild as well as the Pacific Northwest's rich brewing heritage. We produce over 600 barrels of Beer a year in our 4 barrel (120 gallon) Brewhouse and bottle approximately 5000 cases a year. The rest of our beer is served on draft in our tasting room and at a few select accounts in Oregon and elsewhere. Hair of Dog is proud to be one of the first breweries in America specializing in the production of high alcohol, bottle conditioned beers as well as experimenting with the barrel aging process since 1994. Currently, the brewery has 180 oak barrels used to age Beer from 6 months to 8 years. We use new oak as well as previously filled spirit and wine barrels. All the Beer is made by two Brewers, Denver Bon and Alan Sprints. We are also dedicated to buying local products for both the Brewery and restaurant in an effort to keep as much of our money in our community. We work directly with farmers whenever possible and are proud to say that 99% of all the ingredients we use are produced within a 350 mile radius of the brewery. Our Organic Pilsner malt is from Gambrinus Malting in British Columbia, the water runs pure from the Cascade mountain range, hops are grown in Oregon and Washington and both bottles and labels are made in Portland. Since we opened all the graphic design has been created by the Felt Hat of Portland. The original brewing equipment has been recycled from other industries and is still in use today.

Our beers are brewed on site from a seven-barrel system with the quality ingredients and care that Oregonians expect. We pride ourselves on being a friendly place for our neighbors to unwind and enjoy great food and great handcrafted beer with family and friends.","coords":{"lat":45.4777,"lon":-122.699}}
